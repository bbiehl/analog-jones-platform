# Changelog

All notable changes to this project are recorded here. The format follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/), and versions are `MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH.MICRO` (the `VERSION` file is the source of truth).

## [1.0.2.0] - 2026-10-10

### Added

- A rollback command for the hosts' release tooling. If a release goes wrong, `pnpm rollback` puts the site back on an earlier version and clears the cached pages, so visitors do not end up on a page that loads but never responds.

### Changed

- Pages on analogjonestof.com load with less code. The site no longer downloads sign-in code that only the admin site uses, which takes about 78 kB off the first visit.
- The site now runs on Angular 22. Nothing should look or behave differently.
- A release now moves visitors to the new version by itself, including after a rollback.

### Fixed

- The release command stops when given an option it does not recognise, instead of ignoring it and releasing anyway.

## [1.0.1.0] - 2026-10-09

### Changed

- Fonts and icons are now served from analogjonestof.com itself. Loading a page no longer sends a request to Google Fonts.
- The Privacy Policy has a new "Fonts and icons" section saying so.

### Removed

- The Material Icons font. The menu and clear-search icons are drawn inline instead.

## [1.0.0.3] - 2026-10-09

### Fixed

- The footer credit now spells the name correctly: WillaWave.

## [1.0.0.2] - 2026-10-09

### Added

- `llms.txt` now opens with an About section describing the podcast, its hosts, the archive, and what each episode page contains, so AI assistants can describe the site accurately.

### Changed

- The one-line site summary in `llms.txt` now leads with the VHS focus.

## [1.0.0.1] - 2026-10-09

### Added

- The footer now credits WillaWave, with a link to willawave.ai.

### Changed

- The GitHub link on the Contact page points to the project's new home under the WillaWave organization.

## [1.0.0.0] - 2026-10-09

The baseline: the site as it stands on the day versioning was introduced.

### Added

- Public site at analogjonestof.com: home page, a browsable episode archive, a page for every episode, and an Explorer for searching episodes by category, genre, and tag.
- Contact, Terms of Use, and Privacy Policy pages.
- Server-rendered pages for search engines, with a sitemap, an `llms.txt` summary for AI crawlers, and redirects from the old site's URLs.
- Admin app for the hosts: sign in with Google to add and edit episodes, manage categories, genres, and tags (including bulk edits across episodes), and manage users.
